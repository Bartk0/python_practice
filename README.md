[here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches#:~:text=The%20git%20branch%20command%20lets,checkout%20and%20git%20merge%20commands)
5) Switch to new branch with command `git switch`. 
[Example](https://www.studytonight.com/git-guide/git-switch-branch)
6) Create new project and file `strings_basics.py` in new branch. 
[Example](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-and-running-your-first-python-project.html)
7) In file create a script that will `print` to console "Hello world." with this 
[example](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/hello-world#)
8) Push file to remote repository with commands
